First, I want to greet you a happy birthday Rosemarie or should I say TANYA? (laughing emoji). Hindi ko alam ilalagay ko dito pero all I wanna say is I am really happy and proud on where or where ever you are right now in your life HAHHASHSA like really.. I just hope na you keep on going lang even if it's feels like life is slowly draining you down the drain. Remember there will always be a bright side out there somewhere and I am sure na you will be in that place, you have goals so go for it. I really miss u na, gusto ko mag kita us pero you see life is a little not on my side right now so here I am typing this message sa notepad at 2:45 A.M tapos icocompile ko pa mamaya HAHAHAHA anyways hope you enjoy this little thing I made for you :>
